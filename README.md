Работа над проектом текстового редактора с применением библиотеки SWING. Решение задачи HyperSkill.
# Work on project. Stage 1/4: A window to editing
When you are programming, you use a text editor. But you can do a lot more with a text editor than just programming. You can make notes in the text files and save important or temporary information somewhere. In this project, you will write a functional text editor that allows you to do the same things. We will use Swing to create a graphical user interface (GUI).

In Swing, the class that represents an empty window is JFrame. Actually, all of the classes that represent graphic elements in Swing start with the letter 'J.' Don't confuse these classes with classes that represent graphic elements of the AWT library (for example, the class Button in the AWT library versus the class JButton in the Swing library).
