# Work on project. Stage 3/4: Menu, please!
Also, in this stage, you should implement a menu bar. It is the GUI element that sits in the top left corner of the screen and pops up with different options when you click on it. This should be implemented using JMenuBar, whose menu lists are implemented using JMenu and whose menu items are implemented using JMenuItem. You should add an ActionListener to every JMenuItem in the menu bar. The menu bar should contain three options: Load, Save and Exit, which duplicate the buttons Load, Save, and the "Exit" option which should shut down the application. To safely close the window, you should call a method dispose() on the JFrame.
